# GPTuner

This repository hosts the source code and supplementary materials for our VLDB 2024 submission, "GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian Optimization". Specifically, GPTuner collects and refines heterogeneous domain knowledge, unifies a structured view of the refined knowledge, and uses the knowlege to (1) select important knobs, (2) optimize the search space in terms of the value range of each knob and (3) explore the optimized space with a novel Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework.
