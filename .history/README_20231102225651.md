# GPTuner

This repository hosts the source code and supplementary materials for our VLDB 2024 submission, "GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian Optimization". GPTuner is a manual-reading database tuning system that leverages domain knowledge automatically and extensively to enhance knob tuning process. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space.
